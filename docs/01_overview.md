# 01 â€” Overview

This chapter explains what MCP is, why it exists, core goals, and common usage patterns.

## Use-cases (concrete)
- LLM tool invocation (search, code execution, DB query)
- Model fetching structured context (user profile, transaction history)
- Agent orchestration (model coordinates tasks calling many tools)
- Secure secrets retrieval with audit trails

## Non-goals
- MCP is not an LLM training format.
- MCP does not prescribe internal model prompt engineering.
