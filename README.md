# MCP Complete Guide: Comprehensive Starter Kit for Model Context Protocol Servers

**The most exhaustive repository spec for Model Context Protocol (MCP) and MCP servers. Learn how to build, secure, and deploy MCP servers with this complete guide.**

This repository contains everything you need for MCP server development:
- **Formal Specifications**: JSON Schema, Protobuf, and OpenAPI specs for MCP protocol
- **Reference Implementations**: Multi-language servers in Python (aiohttp), Node.js (Express + WebSocket), and Go (gRPC + HTTP)
- **SDKs and Tools**: Client SDKs for Python, Node.js, Go, plus CLI tool `mcpctl` for testing
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated builds, security scans, SBOM generation, and containerization
- **Deployment Ready**: Kubernetes Helm charts, Dockerfiles, and example manifests
- **Observability Suite**: OpenTelemetry tracing, Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards
- **Security Best Practices**: OPA Rego policies, mTLS examples, OAuth2 setup, threat models
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, contract tests, fuzzing, load testing with k6 and locust
- **Operational Runbooks**: Incident response, key rotation, data exfiltration handling

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/kawacukennedy/mcp-complete-guide.git`
2. Run a server: `cd examples/python_server && python server/server.py`
3. Explore docs in `docs/` or use the CLI: `./tools/mcpctl/mcpctl.py manifest http://localhost:8080`

See `SUMMARY.md` for the full table of contents and dive into `docs/` for detailed chapters on MCP protocol, security, observability, and more.
